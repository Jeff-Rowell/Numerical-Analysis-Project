Benchmarks the time for Midpoint, Trapezoidal, and Simpson's rules to approximate an integral given different tolerances to meet.
Generates a scatter plot of the computational cost versus the accuracy on a log-log scale, then uses a linear regression to extrapolate 
future computational costs for Midpoint and Trapezoidal rules, but we use a quadratic fit for Simpson's rule.
