# Numerical_Analysis_Project
Benchmarks the time for Midpoint, Trapezoidal, and Simpson's rules to approximate an integral given different accuracies to meet.
Generates a scatter plot of the computational cost versus the accuracy on a log-log scale, then uses linear regression to extrapolate 
future computational costs for Midpoint and Trapezoidal rules. Uses a quadratic fit for Simpson's rule to better fit the points.
